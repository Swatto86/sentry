# Eir

**An autonomous Windows system-repair agent.**

Eir watches your machine's health, diagnoses problems with an AI model, and fixes
them — asking for approval before anything risky.

## What it is

Eir is a background agent for Windows that continuously monitors system health —
event logs, failed services, disk pressure, memory, network errors — and uses an
AI model as its reasoning engine to work out *what's actually wrong* and *the
least-destructive way to fix it*.

It runs as a pair:

- **`EirSvc`** — a Windows service running as **LocalSystem**, so it can read
  protected logs and apply fixes without a UAC prompt. It does the monitoring,
  reasoning, and (approved) repairs.
- **Eir tray app** — a lightweight desktop UI that shows current status, recent
  problems and executions, AI usage/cost, and app updates. It's where you approve
  fixes and change every setting.

The two talk over a secured local named pipe (`\\.\pipe\EirSvc`).

> The name comes from **Eir**, the Norse goddess of healing — the agent doesn't
> just *watch* the system, it *mends* it. (Pronounced "air".)

```

Each decision cycle (default every 10 minutes):

1. **Collect signals** — Windows Event Log channels, service states, CPU/memory/disk,
   network errors, watched log directories.
2. **Decide whether to think** — Eir only calls the AI when something *actionable*
   has changed (a fingerprint of the current problems), plus a periodic heartbeat so
   a healthy machine still reports in. Idle cycles are essentially free.
3. **Diagnose** — the AI returns a structured list of problems, each with a
   confidence score and a proposed root-cause fix.
4. **Gate through policy** — findings below your confidence threshold (default 80%,
   adjustable in Settings) and benign Windows noise are dropped; software uninstall
   is *never* executed; a few catastrophic actions (boot-config edits, driver
   disabling, arbitrary PowerShell) always require approval.
5. **Execute** — reversible whitelisted fixes (service restart/start/stop, log/disk
   cleanup, task enable/disable, registry reset, process kill, file delete) run
   automatically at or above the confidence threshold. Anything disruptive or
   irreversible is queued for approval in the tray UI — each item explains, in
   plain English, exactly what it will do (and, for a file delete, the file's real
   size, age, and what kind of file it is). The queue is persistent: it never
   times out and survives a service restart, so an approval is always waiting for
   you, not gone if you missed a pop-up.

## AI providers

Everything is configurable in the **Settings** panel — no file editing required.

| Provider | Cost | Web search | Notes |
|----------|------|------------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** *(default)* | Free models | Yes — web plugin | Recommended. `openrouter/free` auto-routes to a current free model; needs an API key. Doesn't touch your Claude plan. |
| **Claude CLI** | Uses your Claude plan | Yes | No API key — reuses your logged-in `claude` session. |
| **Anthropic API** | Pay-as-you-go | Yes | Direct API key from console.anthropic.com. |
| **OpenAI-compatible** | Depends | No | Any OpenAI-style endpoint (e.g. a local proxy). |

The monitoring loop and the **app-update check** both use your configured provider.
The app-update check needs live web search: on OpenRouter it uses the web plugin
(works with free models — about £0.004 per check for the search), and on the Claude
CLI it uses the CLI's built-in search (`update_check_model`, default **Haiku**).

## Features

- **Autonomous diagnosis & repair** of common Windows faults, root-cause first —
  reversible fixes run automatically, no babysitting.
- **Tunable autonomy** — set the auto-fix confidence threshold in Settings (default
  80%): lower to act on weaker hunches, higher to be more cautious.
- **Approval backstop** — disruptive or irreversible actions (closing a program,
  deleting a file, boot-config edits, driver disabling, arbitrary PowerShell) always
  require your say-so; they're never auto-run. Each pending action shows a
  plain-English summary of what it does, whether it can be undone, and — for a file
  delete — the target's real size, last-modified date, and likely kind (regenerable
  cache vs. irreplaceable data). The approval queue is persistent: it never expires
  and survives restarts, so nothing slips away while you're not looking.
- **Never-uninstall guarantee** — software removal is a hard-blocked action.
- **App updates, applied for you** — one panel updates everything. `winget`-managed
  apps update in a single batch; apps no package manager tracks are handled by the
  AI: it finds the official installer via web search, and Eir validates it
  (https-only, trusted-host/vendor-domain gating, `.exe`/`.msi` only, size-bounded
  download, SHA-256 + Authenticode recorded), installs it silently, and **verifies
  the new version is actually installed** — every result shown as Verified / Installed
  (unverified) / Failed. One **⬆ Update everything** button does the lot; per-app
  notes still let you correct or silence false positives for your own self-built apps.
- **Usage transparency** — shows AI calls, tokens, and estimated cost in **GBP**.
  Free models are clearly marked as no-cost.
- **Self-updating** — signed auto-updates via the GitHub releases feed.
- **Stays out of the way** — closing the window hides to the tray; the service keeps
  running.

## Install

1. Download **`Eir_<version>_x64-setup.exe`** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/Swatto86/eir/releases/latest).
2. Run it **as Administrator**. The installer registers and starts the `EirSvc`
   service and seeds the default config.
3. Launch **Eir** from the Start Menu — the tray icon appears once the service
   connects.
4. The default provider is **OpenRouter**. Open **Settings**, paste your
   [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys), and Save — that's all it needs
   (the `openrouter/free` model is preset). Prefer Claude? Switch the provider to
   **Claude CLI**, which uses your logged-in `claude` session and needs no key.

Already installed? Eir updates itself automatically.

## Configuration

All settings live in the in-app **Settings** panel: AI provider and models, API
keys, polling intervals, watched event-log channels and directories. The service
persists them to `config.toml` next to its executable and restarts to apply.

`config.toml.example` documents every field for reference, but you should never need
to edit it by hand.

## Building from source

Requirements: **Rust** (stable, MSVC toolchain), **Tauri CLI**, and Windows.

```powershell
# 1. Tauri CLI (once)
cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2"

# 2. (Optional) regenerate the icons
powershell -NoProfile -File icons\gen-icon.ps1

# 3. Build the installer. This runs build-svc.ps1 first (which compiles EirSvc
#    and stages bin\eir-svc.exe), then bundles the tray app + service into NSIS.
cargo tauri build --config eir-ui/tauri.conf.json
```

Run the checks the way CI does:

```powershell
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

## Project layout

| Crate | Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| `eir-proto` | shared | Wire types for the UI ↔ service pipe protocol. |
| `eir-svc` | service | LocalSystem service: signal collection, AI client, policy, execution, audit DB. |
| `eir-ui` | presentation | Tauri tray app; static frontend in `ui/`. |

## Security model

- The service runs as **LocalSystem**; the UI runs at **Medium** integrity (normal
  user). They communicate only over the local named pipe `\\.\pipe\EirSvc`.
- The pipe is created with an explicit security descriptor —
  `D:(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GRGW;;;AU)S:(ML;;NW;;;ME)` — granting authenticated
  users read/write while a Medium mandatory-label SACL lets the Medium-integrity UI
  write to it (no-write-up). No network listener is opened.
- Destructive actions are blocked at the policy layer and require explicit approval;
  software uninstalls are never permitted.
- API keys are stored in the local `config.toml` and never logged.
