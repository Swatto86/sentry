# Eir

**An autonomous Windows system-repair agent.**

Eir watches your machine's health, diagnoses problems with an AI model, and fixes
them — asking for approval before anything risky.

</div>

---

## What it is

Eir is a background agent for Windows that continuously monitors system health —
event logs, failed services, disk pressure, memory, network errors — and uses an
AI model as its reasoning engine to work out *what's actually wrong* and *the
least-destructive way to fix it*.

It runs as a pair:

- **`EirSvc`** — a Windows service running as **LocalSystem**, so it can read
  protected logs and apply fixes without a UAC prompt. It does the monitoring,
  reasoning, and (approved) repairs.
- **Eir tray app** — a lightweight desktop UI that shows current status, recent
  problems and executions, AI usage/cost, learned machine-specific patterns, and
  app updates. It's where you approve fixes and change every setting.

The two talk over a secured local named pipe (`\\.\pipe\EirSvc`).

> The name comes from **Eir**, the Norse goddess of healing — the agent doesn't
> just *watch* the system, it *mends* it. (Pronounced "air".)

## How it works

```

                                                       ┌────────▼─────────┐
                                                       │   AI provider    │
                                                       │  OpenRouter /    │
                                                       │  Claude / API    │
                                                       └──────────────────┘
```

Each decision cycle (default every 10 minutes):

1. **Collect signals** — Windows Event Log channels, service states, CPU/memory/disk,
   network errors, security posture (firewall & Defender), watched log directories.
2. **Decide whether to think** — Eir only calls the AI when something *actionable*
   has changed (a fingerprint of the current problems), plus a periodic heartbeat so
   a healthy machine still reports in. Idle cycles are essentially free.
3. **Diagnose** — the AI returns a structured list of problems, each with a
   confidence score and a proposed root-cause fix.
4. **Gate through policy** — findings below your confidence threshold (default 80%,
   adjustable in Settings) and benign Windows noise are dropped; software uninstall
   is *never* executed; a few catastrophic actions (boot-config edits, driver
   disabling, arbitrary PowerShell) always require approval.
5. **Execute** — reversible whitelisted fixes (service restart/start/stop, log/disk
   cleanup, task enable/disable, registry reset, firewall re-enable, Defender
   signature update) run automatically at or above the confidence threshold. Anything disruptive or
   irreversible is queued for approval in the tray UI — each item explains, in
   plain English, exactly what it will do (and, for a file delete, the file's real
   size, age, and what kind of file it is). The queue is persistent: it never
   times out and survives a service restart, so an approval is always waiting for
   you, not gone if you missed a pop-up.
6. **Learn conservatively** — Eir mines its own audit history for repeated local
   patterns, such as package-manager methods that always fail for a specific app or
   fixes that never improve a recurring issue. Learned facts can only reduce or
   reorder actions, never make Eir more aggressive, and every fact is visible in the
   UI with Pin / Disable / Forget controls.

## AI providers

Everything is configurable in the **Settings** panel — no file editing required.

Four providers:

| Provider | Cost | Web search | Notes |
|----------|------|------------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** *(default)* | Free models | Yes — web plugin | Recommended. `openrouter/free` auto-routes to a current free model; needs an API key. |
| **Claude CLI (your subscription)** | Uses your Claude plan | Yes — CLI built-in | **No API key** — reuses your logged-in `claude` session; profile and binary auto-detected. |
| **Claude (Anthropic API)** | Pay-as-you-go | Yes — native web_search tool | API key from console.anthropic.com; token usage tracked, cost estimated from list pricing. |
| **Kilo Code** | Depends on model | No | One key for 500+ models via the Kilo gateway (app.kilo.ai); models in `provider/model` format, e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` or `minimax/minimax-m3` for the Minimax coding plan (BYOK key works the same way — paste it, set the model, save). |
| **Kilo Code — your subscription (Kilo CLI)** | Uses your Kilo plan (Pass + addon BYOK included) | Yes — the CLI's built-in | **No API key** — borrows your logged-in `kilo` session, same way the Claude CLI borrows a logged-in Claude subscription. Install with `npm install -g @kilocode/cli`, run `kilo` once to sign in, then pick the provider in Settings with a `provider/model` id (e.g. `minimax/minimax-m3`). Profile / binary are auto-detected. |

The monitoring loop and the **app-update check** both use your configured provider.
The app-update check uses live web search where the provider supports it: OpenRouter's
web plugin (works with free models — about £0.004 per check for the search),
Anthropic's native web-search tool, or the Claude CLI's built-in search
(`update_check_model`, blank = a cheap Haiku default). On Kilo Code the check runs
from model knowledge and Eir's validation gates.

## Features

- **Autonomous diagnosis & repair** of common Windows faults, root-cause first —
  reversible fixes run automatically, no babysitting.
- **Tunable autonomy** — set the auto-fix confidence threshold in Settings (default
  80%): lower to act on weaker hunches, higher to be more cautious.
- **Approval backstop** — disruptive or irreversible actions (closing a program,
  deleting a file, boot-config edits, driver disabling, arbitrary PowerShell) always
  require your say-so; they're never auto-run. Each pending action shows a
  plain-English summary of what it does, whether it can be undone, and — for a file
  delete — the target's real size, last-modified date, and likely kind (regenerable
  cache vs. irreplaceable data). The approval queue is persistent: it never expires
  and survives restarts, so nothing slips away while you're not looking.
- **Never-uninstall guarantee** — software removal is a hard-blocked action.
- **Machine-pattern learning** — repeated local evidence teaches Eir which app-update
  paths, signals, or fixes are not useful on this machine. Learning is conservative,
  decays/rechecks over time, and is fully user-overridable from the tray UI.
- **Reacts as errors land** — signal collectors wake the decision loop the moment an
  error appears (debounced ~10 s, at most once a minute), so fixes start in seconds
  instead of on the next scheduled sweep.
- **Advisor mode** — optional bounded escalation that lets Eir re-run one analysis at
  a stronger model or higher reasoning effort when the base model flags ambiguity or
  reports low confidence. Daily spend and attempt caps keep it bounded.
- **App updates, applied for you** — one panel updates everything. `winget`-managed
  apps update in a single batch; apps no package manager tracks are handled by the
  AI: it finds the official installer via web search, and Eir validates it
  (https-only, trusted-host/vendor-domain gating, `.exe`/`.msi` only, size-bounded
  download, SHA-256 + Authenticode recorded), installs it silently, and **verifies
  the new version is actually installed** — every result shown as Verified / Installed
  (unverified) / Failed. One **⬆ Update everything** button does the lot; per-app
  notes still let you correct or silence false positives for your own self-built apps.
- **Usage transparency** — shows AI calls, tokens, and estimated cost in **GBP**.
  Free models are clearly marked as no-cost.
- **Self-updating** — signed auto-updates via the GitHub releases feed.
- **Stays out of the way** — closing the window hides to the tray; the service keeps
  running. The tray app can start with Windows and launch hidden.

## Install

1. Download **`Eir_<version>_x64-setup.exe`** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/Swatto86/eir/releases/latest).
2. Run it **as Administrator**. The installer registers and starts the `EirSvc`
   service and seeds the default config.
3. Launch **Eir** from the Start Menu — the tray icon appears once the service
   connects.
4. The default provider is **OpenRouter**. Open **Settings**, paste your
   [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys), and Save — that's all it needs
   (the `openrouter/free` model is preset). Prefer Claude? Switch the provider to
   **Claude — your subscription (Claude CLI)**, which reuses your logged-in
   `claude` session and needs no key — or use an Anthropic API key / Kilo Code
   key (console.anthropic.com / app.kilo.ai) plus a model.

Already installed? Eir updates itself automatically.

## Configuration

All settings live in the in-app **Settings** panel: start-with-Windows, AI provider
and models, API keys, advisor escalation, polling intervals, watched event-log
channels and directories, and app-updater settings. Provider/monitoring settings are
persisted to `config.toml` next to the service executable and the service restarts to
apply them; updater/advisor settings apply live.

`config.toml.example` documents every field for reference, but you should never need
to edit it by hand.

## Building from source

Requirements: **Rust** (stable, MSVC toolchain), **Tauri CLI**, and Windows.

```powershell
# 1. Tauri CLI (once)
cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2"

# 2. (Optional) regenerate the icons
powershell -NoProfile -File icons\gen-icon.ps1

# 3. Build the installer. This runs build-svc.ps1 first (which compiles EirSvc
#    and stages bin\eir-svc.exe), then bundles the tray app + service into NSIS.
cargo tauri build --config eir-ui/tauri.conf.json
```

Run the checks the way CI does:

```powershell
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

## Project layout

| Crate | Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| `eir-proto` | shared | Wire types for the UI ↔ service pipe protocol. |
| `eir-svc` | service | LocalSystem service: signal collection, AI client, policy, execution, audit DB. |
| `eir-ui` | presentation | Tauri tray app; static frontend in `ui/`. |

## Security model

- The service runs as **LocalSystem**; the UI runs at **Medium** integrity (normal
  user). They communicate only over the local named pipe `\\.\pipe\EirSvc`.
- The pipe is created with an explicit security descriptor —
  `D:(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)(A;;GRGW;;;AU)S:(ML;;NW;;;ME)` — granting authenticated
  users read/write while a Medium mandatory-label SACL lets the Medium-integrity UI
  write to it (no-write-up). No network listener is opened.
- Destructive actions are blocked at the policy layer and require explicit approval;
  software uninstalls are never permitted.
- API keys are stored in the local `config.toml` and never logged.
