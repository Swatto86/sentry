//! Machine-pattern self-improvement.
//!
//! Eir learns patterns about the specific machine from its own audit history and adapts
//! — deterministically, with no AI in the write-path, and only ever toward *more*
//! conservative behaviour (skip, deprioritise a method, lower confidence). See
//! ARCHITECTURE.md "Self-improvement" for the full design.
//!
//! Facts are derived each cycle from the audit tables, persisted to `learned_facts`
//! (migration 0008), and applied at existing decision seams. Detection runs in two
//! places on already-collected data (no AI, no extra external I/O):
//! [`analyse_updates`] in the updater cycle (self-updaters, failing methods) and
//! [`analyse_issues`] in the decision loop (ineffective fixes, user-rejected actions).
