//! winget/choco/scoop launched from the LocalSystem service can hang indefinitely
//! (winget's source refresh as SYSTEM is a known case). An unbounded `Command::output()`
//! then wedges the whole update cycle, and because no `CycleSummary` is ever produced
//! the updater's "running" state latches forever. Every external command the updater
//! runs goes through [`run_capped`]/[`run_capped_cmd`], which terminates the child if
//! it overruns its deadline (`kill_on_drop` fires when the timed-out future is dropped).
