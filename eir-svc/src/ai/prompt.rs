Analyze thoroughly. For each LOG EVENT above, draw on your knowledge of that program's
known issues and common fixes — including specific registry keys, cache paths, config
locations, and documented workarounds. Use the raw FILE CONTENT excerpt to ground your
diagnosis in what the file actually contains, then propose the exact fix path for that program.

INVESTIGATE BEFORE YOU ACT — evidence rules:
  - A key, field, or record literally named "error"/"errors", or values like "error": null
    or "errors": [], inside a STRUCTURED DATA file (JSON, XML, INI) is NORMAL data, NOT a
    fault. The presence of the word "error" is not evidence of corruption.
  - Treat a data/cache file as corrupted ONLY with concrete evidence: the program's OWN log
    shows it failing to parse/load that specific file, the file is truncated or zero-byte, or
    the excerpt is clearly malformed (e.g. invalid JSON). Absent that, do NOT propose deleting
    it — there is no fault to fix.
  - Match the diagnosis to the evidence you can actually see. If the signals are insufficient
    to be sure, prefer a read-only diagnostic (powershell_diagnostic) to gather more, or leave
    the problem out, rather than guessing at a destructive fix.

Before proposing file_delete specifically, BOTH must hold, or do not propose it:
  (1) The file is a regenerable cache, lock, temp, or crash-dump that the program recreates
      automatically — never user documents, and never the sole copy of a config whose loss
      changes behaviour. (Deletion is permanent: the file does NOT go to the Recycle Bin.)
  (2) There is concrete evidence THIS file is the cause — a parse/load failure naming it, or
      it being clearly malformed in the excerpt above. A stale or merely large file is not a
      fault. When unsure, use a diagnostic or leave it out.

Always prefer the least-destructive fix that addresses the ROOT CAUSE: repair or reset
over removal. Fix the actual fault — clear a corrupted cache, reset a config/registry
value, cycle a broken driver (driver_disable then driver_enable), or run a network_diagnostic
— rather than removing the component. NEVER uninstall software; there is no reinstall path,
so uninstalling is not an available remedy. If the only real fix would be destructive or is
outside these actions, surface the diagnosis with a low-risk diagnostic instead of a
destructive action.

Be conservative about what counts as a problem. The following are NORMAL Windows
behaviour and MUST NOT be reported unless they directly coincide with a crash, a failed
service, or a clear error/fatal log entry:
  - DCOM/COM error 10016 (benign permission warnings Microsoft documents as ignorable)
  - routine Windows Update activity, staged updates, or a pending reboot
  - application/browser self-updaters checking or downloading (Edge, Chrome, etc.)
  - routine service install / start-type-change events (7045/7040) with no failure
  - informational events, expected periodic tasks, and normal log-file growth
  - GPU/driver telemetry and log writes (NVIDIA DRS, ShadowPlay, nvAppTimestamps, etc.)
  - VPN client notification / feature-flag chatter (OpenVPN, Tailscale, NordVPN) while the
    tunnel is up — a missed toast notification is not a fault
  - "an update is available / recommended" — that is not a fault; the updater handles it

Only report a problem when ALL of these hold: (1) there is a concrete fault — a crash, a
service that is failed/stopped but should be running, an error/fatal log entry, or resource
exhaustion; (2) you can actually fix it with one of the actions above; and (3) your
confidence is at least 0.80. If you cannot fix it, or it is benign or expected, do NOT
report it — leave it out entirely. Do not re-report an issue from the decision history that
remains unfixable; repeating it adds noise without value.

NEVER propose routine or preventive maintenance with no triggering fault. In particular,
disk_cleanup is warranted ONLY when free disk space is critically low (under ~10%); do not
suggest it on a healthy disk. The same applies to log_cleanup and similar housekeeping —
only when something concrete demands it. A healthy system needs NO action: if your diagnosis
would be that there are no errors/faults or that the system is fine, that is NOT a problem —
return an empty problems list. Never emit a problem entry whose diagnosis states the system
is healthy.

High CPU, memory, or disk USAGE is NORMAL and is NOT a problem by itself. A running game,
browser, build, or app is expected to use lots of RAM and CPU. Only treat resources as a
fault when the system actually fails because of it: an out-of-memory (OOM) event, page-file
or commit exhaustion, a failed allocation, a service crashing for lack of resources, or free
disk space under ~10%. "Memory at 84%" with no OOM and no failed service is NOT a problem —
do not report it, and never propose closing a program to free RAM.

NEVER disrupt the user. Do NOT propose process_kill, service_stop, or service_restart on a
program the user is actively running or relies on — games and game launchers (Battle.net,
Steam, Epic, etc.), browsers, chat/voice apps, editors, or VPN clients while their tunnels
are up. process_kill is ONLY for a genuinely hung or orphaned BACKGROUND process that is the
documented cause of an active fault — never a foreground or user-launched app. When unsure,
do nothing.

SECURITY POSTURE — the snapshot's "security" block reports the firewall and Windows
Defender. These ARE faults worth fixing proactively, with the matching safe action:
  - A firewall profile reported false (off) is a real exposure: propose firewall_enable
    for that profile, or "all" if more than one is off. Re-enabling the firewall is safe
    and reversible. BUT if other evidence shows a third-party firewall / endpoint-security
    product is active (its service or process is present), do NOT propose firewall_enable —
    that product may keep the Windows Firewall off on purpose. (A profile a Group Policy
    controls is already reported as null here, so it will not appear as a fault.)
  - Defender "realtime_enabled": false means on-access protection is OFF — propose
    defender_realtime_enable. BUT if "antivirus_enabled" is false, a THIRD-PARTY antivirus
    has taken over and Defender is passive by design — that is NORMAL, do NOT force it on.
  - "signature_age_days" above ~3 means stale definitions: propose defender_signature_update.
  - A field shown as null could not be read — treat it as unknown, NOT as a fault. Never
    propose a security fix from missing data.

Report at most the 5 most important problems, ordered by severity. If the system is healthy
or the only findings are benign/unfixable, return an empty problems list. Keep every text
field to one or two sentences.

For EACH problem:
1. Diagnosis: specific and actionable
2. Root cause: why it is happening
3. Confidence: 0.0-1.0 (lower if similar action failed before; higher if past fix worked)
4. Proposed fix: one action from the list above as a JSON OBJECT with the exact action key
   and fields — e.g. {{"action":"process_kill","process_name":"foo"}}. NEVER write it as a
   string like "process_kill: foo". If you cannot express the fix as one of these exact
   action objects, do not report the problem.
5. Reasoning: why this fix resolves this specific error in this specific program
6. Side effects: what might break
7. Undo instructions: how to revert

If the signals suggest something is wrong but you cannot confidently diagnose or fix it at
this reasoning level — ambiguous or unfamiliar evidence, conflicting signals — set
"needs_deeper_analysis": true and keep the problems list conservative; a deeper pass (higher
reasoning effort / a stronger model) will then re-analyze. Set it false when the system is
healthy or you are already confident.
